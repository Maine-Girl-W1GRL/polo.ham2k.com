When an operation begins PoLo will enable you to send an activation spot. Reveal the Spotting button using the left pointing arrow in the details area; pressing the button will give you a chance to add a comment to the spot. The spot button will display icons for each of the activities included in the operation that provide self-spotting services.

Re-spotting is done in the same way, with QSY or QRT entered into the Comments window depending on the operators actions.

You can also self-spot by using the `SPOTME` or just `SPME` commands in the callsign entry field. You can add a short comment after a `/`, such as `SPME/QRV`.

PoLo currently supports receiving spots for POTA, SOTA and WWFF, clicking any spot within the list on the spots tab will put all of that contact's details into a new slot on the QSO tab enabling quick and easy contact to be made.

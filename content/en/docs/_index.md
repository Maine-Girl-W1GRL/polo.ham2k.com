This the manual for the Ham2K Portable Logger which is a mobile application currently available through the Google and Apple environments, as well as on Github as PoLo is an Open Source project.

The menu will take you to the various sections on installation, configuration, and tips and tricks. If you are unable to find the answer you need then the Community section will guide to places where you can get further help.

We do suggest you visit the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ham2kapps) for a more visual guide to the application,
in particular the [How-Tos Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLf7WezuuytcevOjItbmQ8Vq8PJdo3JxQ9).
